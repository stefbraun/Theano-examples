# Theano-examples
This repository contains examples for beginners to learn theano. The examples are based on the Stanford CS231 class on http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/  .

It contains:

1. data.pickle       - file containing the data for a 2D toy example
2. softmax.py        - softmax classifier, native python
3. softmax_theano.py - softmax classifier, ported to theano
4. nn.py             - neural network with 2 layers
5. nn_theano.py      - neural network with 2 layers ported to theano
