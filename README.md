# Symbolic computation: basic examples for neural networks
This repository contains examples for beginners to learn theano and/or TensorFlow. The examples are coded once in native python and then ported step by step to Theano and TensorFlow. All examples are based on the Stanford CS231 class on (convolutional) neural networks http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/  .

Files in this repository:

1. data.pickle       - file containing the data for a 2D toy example
2. softmax.py        - softmax classifier, native python
3. softmax_theano.py - softmax classifier, ported to theano
4. softmax_tf.py     - softmax classifier, ported to TensorFlow
4. nn.py             - neural network with 2 layers, native python
5. nn_theano.py      - neural network with 2 layers, ported to theano

Note that the data, weights and biases are defined to fixed values in order to be able to compare the results.
